## 🌟 Azure Data Engineering: End-to-End Tokyo Olympics 2021

A beginner Azure project that analyzes Tokyo Olympic 2021 data using various tools and technologies, including Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks. 🏅

## 📊 Data Sources

The project's architecture includes five primary data sources in the form of CSV files:

- 🏃‍♂️ Athletes Data
- 🧑‍🏫 Coaches Data
- 🚻 Entries by Gender Data
- 🥇 Medals Data
- 🌍 Teams Data

### 📥 Dataset Download

Download the **2021 Olympics in Tokyo** dataset from this Kaggle link. Place the downloaded dataset files in the **data** directory of your project. 🗂️

## 🔄 Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is handled by **Azure Data Factory**, which efficiently brings data from the CSV files into our data processing pipeline. 🚀

## 🗄️ Raw Data Storage

Our raw data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen2**, providing a scalable and secure repository for large datasets. 🔐

## 🔧 Data Transformation

**Azure Databricks** is used for data transformation, enabling us to process and refine the raw data into a more structured and usable format. 🛠️

## 📥 Transformed Data Storage

The transformed data is stored back in **Azure Data Lake Gen2**, making it accessible for further analysis. 📂

## 📈 Analytics

**Azure Synapse Analytics** is employed for advanced analytics and data exploration, allowing us to gain insights from the processed data. 🔍

## 📊 Dashboard Creation

We create visually compelling dashboards using a combination of tools:

- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualizations and reporting. 📉
- **Looker Studio**: For data exploration and analytics. 🔍
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive and insightful dashboards. 📊
